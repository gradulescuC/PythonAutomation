"""1. Variables + print

A variable is a rezerved memory space where we can store information
Unlike other programming languages, in python a variable is created only when a value is assigned to it

Rules for naming a variable:
- variable names must not contain spaces
- variable names must not be named with reserved words (for example we cannot name a variable as print)
- variable names must be unique
- variable names must not start with a number (they can contain numbers as long as they do not start with one)
- usually variables follow the format snake_case or camelCase (usually snake_case)
- variable names should start with lowercase
- variables are case sensitive

        print("Incorrect password. Choose another.")
else:
    print("Incorrect username. Choose another.")

# Note: In order to find out more about a function, we can use CTRL+Click on the specific function

# Variables are case sensitive
# We can copy the value from a variable into another variable
# Example
user_5 = 100 # instruction for defining and initializing a variable
#print(uSer_5) #  This will not work because the variable name is case sensitive and the system will not recognise this name

- Assert is a way to make a validation
- It checks if a specific statement is evaluated as true
- If it is true, the code moves on, otherwise it returns error and the run stops
- Normally all automated tests finish with an assert

6. DATA TYPES


A data type is an information that informs the system about the type of information we can store in a specific variable

The most used data types in python:
- int (short for integer) -> Can store only integer values (1,2,9,99,167834534 etc)
- float -> Can store decimal numbers (16 decimal points)
- bool (short for boolean) -> Can store true or false values  (with first letter in capital letter)
- string -> Can store text

# Examples of dunders:
_x = 7  # it specifies a variable considered through convention as PROTECTED (it cannot be used in other packages). It is NOT dunder
__x = 8 # Variables preceded by __ are dunders and are a way to define PRIVATE variables (they cannot be used outside the class).
                    # The dunders are usually python reserved, so it is not recommended to defined variables as dunders

#Example of dunders:
if __name__ == '__main__':  # It checks if the program is executed individually or it is called from another program
    print("Another module")
    a: int = 5 # We ca declare a variable also by explicitely declaring the data type
    b: str = 'Johny goes to school'

""" 10. STRING (index, len, slicing, metode) / Immutability -> Immutable is when no change is possible over time in a variable. 
In Python, if the value of an object cannot be changed over time, then it is known as immutable. 
Once created, the value of these objects is permanent. 
Also, when we replace the data in a variable we do not actually replace it, we point the same variable name to a different memory location
We can slice a string by using the following sintax: my_str[start_pos,end_pos,step]
